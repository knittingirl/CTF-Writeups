# Registry_Keys_Cheat_Sheet

I would just like to keep track of the registry keys that come up more frequently in CTFs. I'll try to update this over time

Hardware\Description\System\CentralProcessor\0 gives us the CPU type
System\ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName gives us computer name
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to get Autoruns and look for persistence
